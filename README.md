Daniella Tangherlini's SQL Portfolio

##Welcome to my SQL portfolio! In this collection of files, you will find examples of SQL code that I have written personally. SQL is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases, and I am excited to showcase my skills in this area through the projects in this portfolio. Whether you are a fellow SQL enthusiast, a potential employer, or simply interested in learning more about database management, I hope you will find my work informative and engaging. Thank you for taking the time to explore my SQL portfolio!
